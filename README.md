## Ask a question or leave a comment

Go ahead and make a [new issue](https://github.com/ryan-p-randall/feedback/issues/new) if you'd like to ask me a question or if you'd like to leave a comment on one of my blog posts. If you're leaving a comment on a blog post, please make it clear which one. I'll assume it's fine to update that post with your comment (once I decide how to do so), so let me know if you'd prefer your comment just stay here.    

## Twitter  

You may prefer writing to [me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/foureyedsoul) if you're into that whole brevity thing.
